          Ringin Contong is a historic landmark with a unique story and located
          in the center of Jombang's town square. The site features a large
          banyan tree (ringin) planted on October 21, 1910, by Jombang's first
          Regent, Raden Adipati Arya Soeradiningrat V, to commemorate the
          founding of the Jombang Regency. 18 years later, in 1928, the Dutch
          colonial government constructed a large water culvert (contong) that
          passes through the tree's base as part of a water distribution system.
          Over the decades, the tree has grown in this structure, creating a
          visual of nature merging with historical infrastructure. Today, Ringin
          Contong stands as the most iconic symbol of Jombang, representing the
          city's origins and its connection to its colonial past.
