          Hello everyone, my name is Danish Faiq Ibad Yuadi, a second-year
          Bachelor student at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember in the
          Informatics Engineering Department. Currently living in Surabaya,
          specifically in lecturers' housing on Block U.

          I started playing Maimai in mid-2024, and it has become one of my
          hobbies, besides reading. I began playing more often after entering my
          second year. I usually play at GM3 and GM1 because they are the
          closest Maimai cabinets to ITS.

        <p>
          Additionally, I've been a team member for the YouTube channel
          "Engineering Plastics" since 2022. This long-term role has been very
          beneficial; it has allowed me to earn money for savings, gain valuable
          work experience, and significantly improve my communication
          skills (help, my current GPA is still 3.13 (╥﹏╥)).
